## Products Landing Page

This project is my first Landing Page ever and part of a job vancacy challenge.\
While doing it, I was able to learn and practice **Javascript**, **Semantic HTML**, **CSS**, **Responsive CSS**, **Git**, **Now** (to deploy), **React**, **React Hooks** and **HTML Requests**\
Check it out at: https://products.markkop.now.sh/

## Main Difficulties

- Tried to added a Font Size Adjusting Widget, but it didn't look easy enough as I thought
- Learning and applying React Hooks for state management (it was pretty cool!)
- CSS as a whole as I had never such great opportunitty to practice

## Wishlist

- Testing - while I like to create test, I'm still having trouble to know how to properly test the frontend layer
- Font Size Adjusting Widget - to be able to change the page's font size as I thought the default one kinda small
- Animations - "Soon..." text could appear and disappear smoothly, as well as page's sections

## Commands

`git clone <this repository's link>`\
`cd products`\
`yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies\
`yarn star` or `npm start` to run it at `locahost:3000`\
`now` with Now installed in your system to deploy (need to `now login` first)
